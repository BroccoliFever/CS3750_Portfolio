# CS3750_Portfolio
This contains the projects that I worked on during CS3750 at WSU. The included projects are:
* A tic-tac-toe game
* A connect four game that also includes highscore functionality
* An authentication app that salts and hashes users passwords
* The beginnings of a online speed card game using sockets
